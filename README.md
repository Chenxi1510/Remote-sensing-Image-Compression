Remote-sensing Image Compression


This repository contains the code for reproducing the results with trained models (EGA-Net), NWPU-RSC Dataset, and a novel full-reference IQA FITS.

## Requirements

Python==3.6  
torch==1.6.0  
torchvision==0.7.0

Experimental results of different methods on the AID dataset. In each example, the right-most columns represent ground truths for input image. In the other columns, the first row shows the reconstructed results by different methods, and the second row shows the magnified details of the red rectangle.
